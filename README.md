# Getting Started
This tool requires .Net Framework `4.5.2` or above.

## Installing
* Download the latest binary from [here](https://github.com/mrvogiacu/Decrypt-PluralSight-Videos-GUI/releases/download/1.0/Decrypt-PluralSight-Videos-GUI-1.0.zip).
* Extract the zip file, open file DecryptPluralSightVideosGUI.exe.
* Default Pluralsight Path is `C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Pluralsight\courses`

## Troubleshooting
1. In case you experience a "Path too long" exception, try to use an UNC path for export. You can share your local hard drive and connect to it using an UNC path. This way, Windows will use its Unicode API and in turn support path lengths with to 32k characters.
- For example, if your export folder is ```C:\Export```, share the drive with share name ```C``` and use the following export path instead: ```\\localhost\C\Export```.
